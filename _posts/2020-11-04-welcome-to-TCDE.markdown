As the title if this website suggests, this corporation doesn't exist, so the main question is why there should be a website for a company that doesn't exist? well we try to answer this question in this post!

We are living in a world that is constantly being affected by technology. and most of the organizations, facilities etc are not exception. from management method to production line, everything is changing. Now if we look at this change as a project, you can see why we are here.

In the future posts we are going to present you, a step-by-step methodolgy to digitize your manufacturing plant. notice that ererything about our company is generated randomly by artificial intelligence. that is because we want to make sure that we are working in a real situtaion, cause y'know, randomness comes out of reality! or as Eric Hoffer says: "Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature."
