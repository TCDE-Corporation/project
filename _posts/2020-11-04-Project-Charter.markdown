# PROJECT PURPOSE/JUSTIFICATION


## Introduction/Background

In 2015 a new word has been defined: 4th industrial revolution. A good way to develop an understanding of the destination of this path, could be looking where it came from. Therefore what follows is description of the previous three industrial revolutions, from machine age to robotics: 

The First Industrial Revolution was marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to it is between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the United States. 

The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, is the period between 1871 and 1914 that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. 

The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two world wars, resulting from a slowdown of industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. Now if we look at these three industrial revolutions we can see that as throughout history the main goal of this path was to minimize the human interference using technology although this definition is incomplete when you look for other concepts like MIC 2025, but from a western perspective is actually what is happening.

In the fourth industrial revolution concepts like large-scale machine to machine communication, block chain, artificial intelligence and deep learning were born that could lead any industry to an efficient, effective and more accurately a lean production.

## Business Objectives

There are a quite various number of domain that we define as goals:
*	Maximizing the productivity of the facility while reducing long term costs

*	Minimizing the waste of production

*	Developing a faster (almost simultaneous) reaction to indoor casualties.

*	Improving the quality of final product in each crucial aspects (reliability, aesthetics etc.)

*	Cutting out a large amount of external quality costs (e.g. guarantee, maintenance, after-sale services)

*	Improving the organizational culture and education

*	This list is being completed … 

## Current Situation
Shawn Fitzgerald, Research Director for Digital Transformation Strategies at IDC was asked to explain current situation of digital transformation and responded:

>Our DX maturity benchmark of over 1,600 companies tells us 67% are in the early stages of their transformation as “digital explorers” or “digital players.” While a lot of progress has been made, a little less than 5% of companies are fully transformed. The full disruptive impact of DX has not yet been realized, but is well on its way and is going to fundamentally change business markets and how you attract, delight, and retain customers.

## Opportunity Statement
According to an analysis from IDC (at idc.com), after categorizing industrial organizations into two groups:

1) Digital organization : Companies which are digitally transformed or in the process of digital transformation, based upon IDC’s DX (digital transformation) maturity framework

2) None-Digital organization: Companies that have not undertaken any digital initiatives, based upon IDC’s DX maturity framework.

Then, by looking at revenue and profit performance over a five-year period, and the changes that occur within each group, IDC normalized the performance through a Revenue Performance Index (RPI) and Profit Performance Index (PPI), with every organization starting at 100 in 2013. The change in performance was tracked, with increases in the index meaning improved revenue and profit performance and decreases meaning poorer performance.

According to GE Digital data-driven decision-makers demonstrate better outcomes, this can be statistically translated into 4 percent higher productivity, 6 percent greater profitability and 50 percent market value from IT.

## Project Objectives and Success Criteria

The objectives which mutually support the milestones and deliverables for this project have been identified.  In order to achieve success on the Digital transformation project, the following objectives must be met within the designated time and budget allocations:
-	Being able to technically host and analyze the big data driven from production activities.
-	Providing both physical and cyber security to digital transformation platform
-	A 3 percent climb in profit performance index (PPI) by first year after digital transformation
-	A 5 percent rise in revenue performance index (RPI) by first two years  from the official declaration of end for the project. 

## Requirements

This project must meet the following list of requirements in order to achieve success.  
-	The sponcer/company should be able to afford the initial expenses of project; an estimated worth of 10 percent of its current net value. 
-	Solution must be implemented without disruption to operations

Additional requirements may be added as necessary, with project sponsor approval, as the project moves forward.

## Constraints

The following constraints pertain to the digital transformation project:
-	All security hardware and software must be compatible with our current IT platforms
-	All hardware and software must be purchased in accordance with the allocated budget and timeline
-	Two IT specialists and one security specialist will be provided as resources for this project

## Assumptions

The following are a list of assumptions.  Upon agreement and signature of this document, all parties acknowledge that these assumptions are true and correct:
-	This project has the full support of the project sponsor, stakeholders, and all departments
-	The purpose of this project will be communicated throughout the company prior to deployment
-	The IT manager will provide additional resources if necessary

## Preliminary Scope Statement

The DX project will include the design, testing, and delivery of an improved digital transformation framework throughout the organization.  All personnel, hardware, and software resources will be managed by the project team.  All project work will be independent of daily and ongoing operations and all required testing will be done in the IT laboratory.  All project funding will be managed by the project manager up to and including the allocated amounts in this document.  Any additional funding requires approval from the project sponsor.  This project will conclude when the final report is submitted within 30 days after the DX solution is tested and deployed throughout the organization, all technical documentation is complete and distributed to the appropriate personnel, and a list of future considerations regarding to security, optimization, update etc. is complete and submitted to the VP of Technology.

# RISKS

The following risks for the Digital Transformation project have been identified.  The project manager will determine and employ the necessary risk mitigation/avoidance strategies as appropriate to minimize the likelihood of these risks:  
-	Potential disruption to operations during solution deployment
-	External threats breaching internet security via new methods
-	Political restriction regarding to those which will potentially affect the cost/access to DX required technology. 
-	This list will be completed … 

# PROJECT DELIVERABLES

The following deliverables must be met upon the successful completion of the DX project.  Any changes to these deliverables must be approved by the project sponsor.
-	Fully deployed DX solution
